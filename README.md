# SmartLaundry
Smart Laundry is a web application created in .Net Core 2.1 using MVC architecture. 
This laundry management system is an extended version of my student project.

### Examples of implemented features:
- ASP.NET Identity authentication
- Route based localization (en-US and pl-PL languages)
- Connected SendGrid email service
- Fully working laundry management system
  - Dormitories management for whole campus
  - Dormitory rooms management
  - Dormitory laundries management
  - Announcement system for each dormitory
  - Elastic working time for each laundry (with variable count and length of shifts)
  - Reservation of washing machines
- Multiple access levels (achived by implementing role based authorization):
  - Admin
  - Dormitory manager
  - Dormitory porter
  - Dormitory occupant
  - Registered user
- Few examples of unit and integration tests
